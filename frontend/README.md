# myCV - Vue3 template
This's a template for my own curriculum vitae. Made for VueJS 3 (vite) and vuetify 3

### Usage
For customization just edit the **userDatai.vue** file with your own data. 
And also you can edit **MainPage.vue** to change the order of the components. **It's very intuitive!**

Components available (as HTML tags):
```  
<userDescription/>
<userExperience/>
<userContact/>
<userSkills/>
<userEducation/>
<userLanguages/>
<userProjects/>
etc,
...
```
